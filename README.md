# IsWindows
## Is Python running on windows? True or False

This is the easiest library I could think to make to teach myself how to publics to PyPi and make a bundle that can be installed through PIP.

This is a simple project providing one function, **is_windows()** which returns *true* or *false*.  If true the current python instance is running on a Microsoft Windows platform.  If the function returns false the Python instance is not running on a Microsoft Windows platform.
